                Over the course of a semester. our team worked with two local members of
                the disabled community, Simone and Barbara, to identify a problem area,
                and design a product or service that addressed this issue.<br><br>

                Our two mentors had very different disabilities, but we wanted to find an
                area where their experiences overlapped. After extensive conversations
                and research, we determined that both Simone and Barbara had multiple
                negative expereinces when finding new places to eat, particularly in
                regards to casual dining, and finding restaurants that could accomodate
                them without significant advance planning.

              Our team realized that the best solution wasn’t a new product, but
              instead a revised version of a product that was already being used:<br>
              Google Maps.<br><br>

              Our research showed that a significant number of both disabled and
              able-bodied people were using Google Maps, or a comparable app,
              to find restaurant options, particularly when they were already out and
              about. The difference was that our disabled users were not able to find
              out important information for the restaurants around them, like whether
              they had large format menus, or good options for restrictive diets.
              By simply adding more filters and changing the hierarchy of information
              available, our team was able to redesign Google Maps to create an
              easier and more informative experience for users with a wide range of
              needs and abilities, with the potential to add more options in the future.
