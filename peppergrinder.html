        <h2>Pepper Mill</h2>

        <h6 class="course_description">
          This project was created for the Introduction to Industrial Design class 
          <br> at the University of Pennsylvania in the fall of 2021</h6>

        <!-- <div id="peppermill_description">          
          This course provides an introduction to the ideas and techniques of 
            Industrial Design and is intended for students from engineering, design, 
            or business with an interest in multi-disciplinary, needs-based 
            product design methods. It will follow a workshop model, 
            combining weekly lectures on industrial design history, processes, 
            tools, and the profession, with a progressive set of 
            studio-based design projects. It includes overviews of 
            materials/manufacturing, design research, human factors/ergonomics, 
            sustainability, and visual design and communication. 
            This course will not enable one to become an industrial designer 
            but will enable one to understand and appreciate what 
            industrial design does, what it can contribute to society and 
            why it can be so rewarding.<br><br>

            Goals & Objectives:<br>
            Learn how Industrial designers operate and how they approach a project<br>
            Overview of problem-solving techniques used by industrial designers<br>
            Overview of the history of industrial design<br>
            Industrial design communication and visualization techniques 
            (sketching and prototyping)
