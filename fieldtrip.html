            Boozas are digital pets that encourage place-based community interaction and play.
            By acting on behalf of these little beings; users combat unconscious antisocial 
            behaviors, deepen connectedness with those around them, and alleviate loneliness 
            in the process.<br><br>

            You'll interact with your Booza and care for it on the physical device.
            To keep it healthy, you'll need to take it into the real world with you.
            As you walk past other Booza owners in your neighborhood, 
            your Booza might ask to greet their Boozas and maybe even play!
            You'll earn points this way. The more you interact with Booza
            players in your community, the more you'll level up in the game.

            a partner, who was another attendee they did not know. Once they found their partner,
            they were given one of the twelve activities to complete.<br><br>

            During the activities, we tested our digital pet concept by 
            splitting the time in half. For the first half hour, all attendees were
            given a small stuffed animal with a key finder attached to it. 
            To pair each couple, we, as facilitators, would buzz two pre-planned buzzers
            at once, and then have the two individuals find each other. For the second
            half, we texted the participants phones instead of using seperate buzzers.

          <p>
            After receiving feeback on our new concept, we decided to simplify
            the physical device by creating a remote that would instead
            interface with an application users would download onto their phones.
            This brought the device cost down significantly, in addition to 
            increasing the capabilities that we could bring into our activities.

              The experience will cap off with a 45 minute team debrief, 
              lead by someone on your internal team using our free facilitation guide. <br><br>
              We know that this reflection is a critical way to cement learnings 
              from the game play. You'll ask questions about where they struggled
              to communicate effectively, and what they felt went well, 
              as well as how they improved over time. 
              They'll end with a moment of gratitude.<br><br>
              If clients would rather have a personalized debrief, 
              they can add-on a coaching session
              with one of our Workplace Team Coaches.<br><br>

                <li>Our beachhead market is work retreats, which currently makes up one third of

                  to over $500 billion by 2033.</li>
                <li>We will begin by targeting companies with a remote 
                  or hybrid workforce who already pay for retreats.</li>
