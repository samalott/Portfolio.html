          loneliness experiences among young people. Remote workers collaborate 
          less with their “weak tie” colleagues they don’t know as well. At the same time,
          companies are spending more than ever before on the in-person gathering for their

1. People want to make friends organically<br>

            Boozas are digital pets that encourage place-based community interaction and play.
            By acting on behalf of these little beings; users combat unconscious antisocial 
            behaviors, deepen connectedness with those around them, and alleviate loneliness 
            in the process.<br><br>

            You'll interact with your Booza and care for it on the physical device.
            To keep it healthy, you'll need to take it into the real world with you.
            As you walk past other Booza owners in your neighborhood, 
            your Booza might ask to greet their Boozas and maybe even play!
            You'll earn points this way. The more you interact with Booza
            players in your community, the more you'll level up in the game.

            the core assumptions that the product relied on before devloping it 
            any further. To do this, we organized an event to simulate the 
            experience our product provided.<br><br>

          </div>

          <h5>Overview of Event</h5>
          <p>
            To test the concept, our team hosted an event with just over
            thirty attendees who were unaware of what we were planning. We prepared twelve
            different activities that belonged to one of four categories: physical movement, 
            goal-oriented task, personal truths, or cognitive puzzle. <br><br>

            All attendees were instructed to mingle in the space until they were matched with
            a partner, who was another attendee they did not know. Once they found their partner,
            they were given one of the twelve activities to complete.<br><br>

            During the activities, we tested our digital pet concept by 
            splitting the time in half. For the first half hour, all attendees were
            given a small stuffed animal with a key finder attached to it. 
            To pair each couple, we, as facilitators, would buzz two pre-planned buzzers
            at once, and then have the two individuals find each other. For the second
            half, we texted the participants phones instead of using seperate buzzers.

            what did and didn't work in their opinion. We also wanted to
            find out if they would participate in something like this 
            if it was based on more casual interactions instead of an
            organized event.

          <h5>Testing Results</h5>

          <p> 
            Following the event, we also sent our participants a survey
            where we asked questions about demographics, which activities
            were their favorite, as well as an opportunity for
            open-ended feedback. We received some very informative responses:

          Overall, the feeback we received from the event helped to narrow 
          our focus. We decided to pivot our direction to events instead of 
          man-on-the-street interactions. Our participants even suggested that 
          our product could be used as a great ice breaking tool.

            For our second round of prototyping, we needed to redefine
            what the core requirments of our product were. 
            Since our focus was now on events, the physical devices could
            potentially be reusable.<br><br>
