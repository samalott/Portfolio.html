          Nearly every dog owner has faced the struggle of returning home from a long, tiring
          walk with their dog, only to have no convenient way to clean off their pup’s muddy
          paws before they get inside and leave dirty pawprints all over the house. There
          are plenty of products on the market for cleaning dirty paws, but all of them require
          preparation and planning, which doesn’t help when you weren’t expecting your pup
          to come home with feet a darker shade than they were before your walk.

          Pawdramat provides dog owners with a simple, easy
          paw cleaning solution that is always ready for any mess.
          Suitable for use indoors, such as in apartment buildings,
          or outdoors on a back deck, pawdramat is a compact,
          low profile, low-waste solution for dirty paws of all sizes.</div>

        <h3>Background Research</h3>
      <div id="section" class="research">
        
        <p>The primary research methods used for this project were user 
          interviews and academic review. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I spoke to a number of dog owners to get an idea of what types of 
          issues came up during their day-to-day activites regarding their dogs.
        </p>
        <p>
        Pet ownership has increased significantly over the past three decades.
        In 1988, only 56% of U.S. households owned a pet. As of 2023, 66% of 
        U.S. households (86.9 million homes) own a pet, and an estimated 65.1 million 
        of those households are dog owners
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="highlights">
        <div class="pawdramat_insight">
          More than two-thirds of Americans would pass on the perfect home 
          if it wasn’t a good fit for their pets</div>
        <div class="pawdramat_insight">
          Pet parents spend an average of $730 per year on their dogs,<br>
          and in 2022, Americans spent $136.8 billion on their pets overall</div>
        <div class="pawdramat_insight">
          27% of pet parents say that cleaning up after their dog is the biggest 
          challenge when it comes to dog ownersip</div>
      </div>

      <!-- <h3>Insights</h3> -->

      <div>
        <div id="hmw">
          How might we make it easier for dog owners to keep their dog's paws clean, 
          regardless of what type of housing they have?</div>
      </div>

      <h3>Prototyping</h3>
      <div id="section" class="prototyping">
        <p>There were a couple of key requirements that guided the initial development
          for this project:</p>
        <div id="highlights">
          <div class="pawdramat_criteria">
            Indoor or Outdoor Use</div>
          <div class="pawdramat_criteria">
            Low Profile</div>
          <div class="pawdramat_criteria">
            Not Reliant on Water Supply</div>
          <div class="pawdramat_criteria">
            Readily Usable</div>
          <div class="pawdramat_criteria">
            Environmentally Sustainable</div>
        </div>

        <p>In order to address these issues, I implemented the following design decisions:</p>

        <div id="highlights">
          <div class="pawdramat_criteria_details">
          The best way for the solution to be low profile was for it to replace an 
          existing element of decor that most users would already own, so a door
          mat seemed a logical choice. </div>
          <div class="pawdramat_criteria_details">
          In order for this product to be readily useable, but not reliant on an outisde
          water supply, there had to be some way to contain water within the doormat. A wide
          and flat water resevoir made sense for this purpose.</div>
          <div class="pawdramat_criteria_details">
          Many of the alternate products on the market require users
          to plan in advance in order to use them, which doesn't work
          when the weather changes unexpectedly, or you encounter an 
          unforseen mess. </div>
        </div>
                     
        <div class="pawdramat_prototype"></div>

        <div id="highlights">
          <div class="pawdramat_criteria_details">
            A current solution to that dog owners
            were using was disposable pet wipes. The major complaints with these involved
            cost and waste. Having a study device that required no replacements or additional
            purchases gave this solution an advantage.</div>
          <div class="pawdramat_criteria_details">
            To make this solution work for outdoor use, it needed to be able to weather
            the elements and be easily cleaned. The plastic housing is sturdy enough to survive 
            the elements, and the rubber bristles allow the mat to be easily hosed off, or rinsed 
            in a sink. </div>
          <div class="pawdramat_criteria_details">
            For indoor use, it needed to contain the mess in addition to being easy to clean. 
            The dirt collection tray allows dirt and dirty water to be emptied out as needed in
            a trash can or sink. </div>
        </div>

      </div>

      <h3>Validation</h3>
      <div id="section" class="testing">
        <p>In order to evaluate the effectiveness and usabiity of the Pawdramat,
          I brought the product into a number of pet owners homes to get their feedback.
          The overall reaction was very positive, in particular with the owners of larger dogs,
          whose owners said they had a more difficult time keeping clean than owners of
          smaller dogs.
        </p>
        <div class="pawdramat_testing">
          <div class="pawdramat_testing_1"></div>
          <div class="pawdramat_testing_2"></div>
          <div class="pawdramat_testing_3"></div>
        </div>
        <p>Between the experienced usage with these dogs, and talking to their owners, I implemented several
          modifications on the original design. I expanded upon the functionality of the removable, hand-held
          scrubbing portion, and hid it undeneath the top of the mat to accomadate the increase in size. I also
          addressed concerns about water accumulation in the dirt collection tray by adding graduated channels for
          water to flow out of. Finally, I increased the size of the foot spray pedal, and the new compartment open
          pedal, to aid in ease of use.</p>

        </div>
        <p>I also looked into some potential materials that would be best suited for the
          pawdramat if it were to enter the next stage of production. I knew I wanted
          this product to be environmentally sustainable, I visted the materials library
          and looked at both naturally occuring and manufactured materials. Due
          to the outdoor nature of the pawdramat, most natral materials would not
          work. I have been looking into a variety of different bioplastics, which I
          think are the most likely candidate for a suitable material.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="section" class="final">
        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>If I were to keep working on the pawdramat, my next task would be to create a revised physical
          prototype that I could test on the dogs who tried the first one, and new dogs as well. I would also
          keep looking into different options for bioplastics, and potentially other sustainable materials that
          I haven’t thought about yet.</p>
